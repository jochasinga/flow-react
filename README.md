# flow-react tutorial

A step-by-step tutorial to get you started building an NFT mini pet marketplace with [Flow][1], [NFT.storage][2], and React.
Based on [Flowwow](https://github.com/jochasinga/flowwow)

## How to use

The tutorial is broken into several small chapters, each with its own directory with self-contained project.

For example, [ch4](./ch4) is the `Minting Token` chapter with its own [README](./ch4/README.md). To start, simply `cd ch4` and run `npm install && npm run start`, then follow the README for that chapter.

If you missed something or did something differently, you will be able to come back to the path again in the next chapter where the code is already provided.

Don't worry about the dependpencies and styling. They are included for you.
